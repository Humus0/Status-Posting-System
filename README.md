# Status-Posting-System

## Description:
I developed a system that enables users to create and store statuses with personal details and timestamps in a database. The system allows users to search for existing statuses within the database and ensures that each status is associated with a unique status code. This functionality guarantees the creation of distinct codes for different statuses, enhancing data integrity and retrieval.

## Languages Used:
