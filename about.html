            <!-- First question -->
            <label>- What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website?</label>
            </br>
            <!-- Answer to the first question -->
            <p>When making the website I implemented the use of css to make the layout and user interface more usable.
            I did this through the use of the body element as well as using the width to make the user interface more appealing.

            <!-- Second question -->
            <label>- Which part(s) did you have trouble with?</label>
            </br>
            <!-- Answer to the second question -->
            <p>One of the parts that I had trouble with was when validating the stcode as I had trouble finding a method to check whether it was already in he database</p>
            <p>Another problem that I encountered was when adding the share to the database, as I had trouble finding a way to add multiple share options</p>

            <!-- Third question -->
            <label>- What would you like to do better next time?</label>
            </br>
            <!-- Answer to the third question -->
            <p>One thing that I think I should have done was manage my time better. This is as I only started the assignment in the last week of the school holidays which was 
            not the best decision especially as I had near a month to work on it. I think if I had started earlier I could have developed it better and had would have had less stress to complete it.

            <!-- Fourth question -->
            <label>- What you have learnt along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this project? If so, please include the sources.</label>
            </br>
            <!-- Answer to the fourth question -->
            <p>Throughout the creation of this website I have learnt to more effectively use php as well and html and sql. During this project is also when I learnt how to use css as I did not know how to before.
            I used plenty of websites which helped me with many elements of the assignment especially the css portion.
